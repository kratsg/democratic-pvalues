# Democratic p-values

huh? Anyway, [@mhance](https://github.com/mhance) emailed me back in November 23rd, 2018 around 6am about this. He sent me an email with a single [attachment](./democratic_pvalues_pyroot.py) which used PyROOT to compute a bunch of things and make three canvases ([hdp0](./hdp0.pdf), [hsqd](./hsqd.pdf), [hdif](./hdif.pdf)).

For a long time, it was on my to-do list to convert this into equivalent [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/) code and maybe glean some understanding. However, now that I'm getting around to this, I don't know why this came up, or why Mike sent this to me. I asked him, and he vaguely recalls a presentation on this, but it never came up again.

Anyways, this repository is just so I can get closer to [#inboxZero](http://www.43folders.com/43-folders-series-inbox-zero) and achieve nirvana? Maybe? Who knows. Honestly, I'm still not quite sure what to make of the plots just yet, but at least they're reproducible outside of [ROOT](https://root.cern/).
